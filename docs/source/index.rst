Zurich Instruments Utils Documentation
==============================================

zhinst-utils provides a set of helper functions for the native LabOne Python API
called `zhinst.core <https://pypi.org/project/zhinst/>`_.

It offers higher level functions to ease the communication with
`Zurich Instruments <https://zhinst.com>`_ devices. It is not intended to be a
seperate layer above ``zhinst.ziPython`` but rather as a addition.

Apart for a set of generic, not device specific functions the utility also provide
specific functionality for some devices. Currently including:

* SHFQA
* SHFSG
* SHFQC

To see the device utils in action check out the
`LabOne API examples <https://github.com/zhinst/labone-api-examples>`_.
